###### Sprint Retrospective

The sprint workload was perfect, all the user stories and tasks have been completed. No major blockages have been found. Overall this sprint was a success.

For the next sprint, we would spent more time on planning and communication. During the development of the first sprint a merge conflict only occurred once. With better communication this can be avoided.

###### Sprint Review

In this sprint we have managed to complete the project. In this sprint we have completed 2 user stories which are User Stories 4 and 5. We have also created a Class Diagram and completed the tests.

###### Sprint Retrospective

In this sprint we have faced no difficulties. The core of the framework was already built in the first sprint. What we have realised is that for some of the API endpoint request only the happy paths can be tested. This made checking for errors impossible, since it was designed that way. 

At the start of the second sprint we have found that user story 7 is redundant. The data that it returns is what formats the data can be, which is already stated in the API documentation.

Overall, this sprint is a success. We have completed the project and finished creating the framework.
