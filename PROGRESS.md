###### Sprint Retrospective

The sprint workload was perfect, all the user stories and tasks have been completed. No major blockages have been found. Overall this sprint was a success.

For the next sprint, we would spent more time on planning and communication. During the development of the first sprint a merge conflict only occurred once. With better communication this can be avoided.
